# PetShop
Following along to a project in DK's beginner coding course!

This will be my ongoing project following along with the html/css/javascript section of the DK's beginner coding course book. The finished product will be a petshop landing page!

The first part of this landing page will be done with what I am learning in plain html, then i'lll move to styles, finishing it with what I learn about javascript.
